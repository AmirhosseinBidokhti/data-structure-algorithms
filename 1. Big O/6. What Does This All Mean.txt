
What does this all mean
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# As we go on with other components of these materials we see that how useful this Big(O) is when we learn different data structures and their methods.

# we can then evaluate the scenarios to see what is the the best data structure to use based on their methods time complexity, space complexity. 

# Understand all their pros and cons which we can easily understand these with Big O notation.


# this the proper language for us to understand all these complex topic with only a notation.



	DATA STRUCUTRE + ALGORITHMS = PROGRAMS


# Data Structures are simply ways to store data and algorithms are functions or ways to use that data structure to write our programs (the instructions for our machine) and great
  
  programmers have this knowledge that they pick the right (since there is no best) data structure and write the right algorithms which eventually evalutes to the great programs.


# REMEMBER THE 2 RULES OF GOOD CODE: READABLE AND SCALABLE.


# What we just learned till now is going to lay the foundation for the rest of the content we are going to learn.

# We will use big o to see what is a good solution to a problem and what is a bad solution to a problem. Most interview by the way has this core concept included.

# What is the right algorithms and right data structure to use to solve the certain problem/task we are given.
